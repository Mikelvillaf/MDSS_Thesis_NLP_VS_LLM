    Definition of Helpful (1): "A helpful review provides specific details about the
    product''s features, performance, or usage context. It often includes clear pros
    and cons, compares the product to alternatives, offers unique insights, or justifies

    informed decision."

    purely emotional without justification, irrelevant to the product itself (e.g.,
    complaining only about shipping), or contains nonsensical text. It does not provide
    useful information for a potential buyer."
